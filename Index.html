    <p><strong>This example of a logical fallacy explains how using an ad hominem can affect someone’s character and makes them feel sad. But because nobody wants to feel like they’re wrong, they will agree but even after that, liking or disliking someone does not affect your intelligence.</strong></p>
    <h2><em>Description:</em>
    <p>An ad hominem is a fallacy that attacks a person’s character. For example, “If you don’t like Minecraft, then you’re stupid.” This makes you feel obligated to like Minecraft even though your personal opinion on the game does not have anything to do with your intelligence.</p>
